Abstract
--------

Sliding Tiles Puzzles / 15 Puzzles are popular mechanical puzzles
consisting of a set of tiles to be arranged in certain target
constellations. One of the board positions on the most common
rectangular board is empty so that adjacent tiles can slide into
the empty position. Thus that the empty position will be at the
origin of the sliding tile after the move. Historically the most
popular size for the puzzle is 4 times 4 positions. But there are
other sizes available, too. Each tile has a property like a number
written on it. Some puzzles prefer parts of a photograph or drawing
on it so that one single position exists showing the whole image
correctly as a target position after shuffling the puzzle. This
implementation prefers numbers on the tiles in the popular 4 times
4 shape. Numbers are more flexible to arrange them in different
logical orders so that multiple challenges could be played with
the same Sliding Tiles Puzzle. Attractive complex and harder
Sliding Tiles challenges include forming a Magic Square of numbers
with the number tiles or placing the tiles in a constellation
where numbers indicate a possible Chess Knight's Move to follow
while each Sliding Tile Puzzle position is used in the formed
path. The application includes a row of challenges accessible
from the application menu.

History and Background
----------------------

<p>The 15 tiles version of the Sliding Tiles Puzzle is often credited to
  Noyes Palmer Chapman and Sam Loyd.</p>
<p>It is reported that Noyes Palmer Chapman, a postmaster in Canastota,
  New York, USA, might have created the puzzle approximately in 1874 originally.
  Noyes Chapman's puzzle actually consists of 16 tiles and the task must have been
  to build row sums and column sums with tiles labeled from #1 to #16 being
  equal 34. Which makes up a magic square as described even hundreds of years
  ago, e.g in Albrecht D&uuml;rer's <em>Melencolia &sect; I</em>, dated 1514.
  Thus the exact mathematical description with objective to build such
  magic squares is definitively older. That is basically why you might find
  descriptions mentioning Noyes Chapman's version being a precursor puzzle
  for the Sliding Tiles Puzzle only. According to Wikipedia Noyes Chapman
  claimed intellectual property but patent request got rejected since
  a similar patent has already been granted.</p>
<p>Anyway Sam Loyd, a puzzle author and mathematician, is sometimes credited
  to be the creator, too. For sure he played a major role in making the puzzle
  famous in 19th century. Sam Loyd came up with an unsolvable variant with just
  two neighbouring tiles exchanged. This is referred to be the 14 and 15 tiles
  exchanged version of the puzzle (<em>14-15 Puzzle</em>).</p>

<h3>The Name of the Game</h3>
<p>A patent nowadays shall protect a specific technical solution. The rules
  itself cannot be covered by such a patent in modern law. The rules text might
  only be covered by copyrights regulating the authorship of the exact

  misusing any registered trademark. Which is unlikely for any traditional
  name of the puzzle.</p>
